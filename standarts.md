# Standarts

For many projects there is need of resources or material. For example: programs, industrial standarts, language, working material, etc. So because all of this should be clear and simple, there is the need to standartise all of those things. So in the project standarts:

1. Rules for evaluation are created
2. Rescources are evaluated
3. Standarts are set

## Language

1. Language and Terminology
   1. By default all files and documents should be created and written in **english**.
   2. It is recomended to use a recurring terminology for the same things.
2. Exeptions
   1. Tasks and projects wich are related to third parties, are freed from this restrictions. But it would be favorable to, never the less set the project langauge to the deafult language.
   2. Tasks and Projects wich are focused around other langauges or linguistic themes are also freed from this restrictions. For eg. Project to learn english, french, chinese.

## Dates and Time

Date and time formates are applied from ISO 8601.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD
hhmm
hhmm(+/-)hh
```

## File structure



```text
nextcloud
    |- projects
    |- projects-concept
    `- projects-archive
```

### Types

1. Timeless folders or files
   1. A Timeless folder/files is a folder wich is intended to be used all the time, or at least as long as the project lives. For example a folder for storing passwords, because you will update those passwords. This ist the preffered folder/file type, because it helps with reusabllity and esthetics.
2. Timestamped folders or files
   1. Timestamped folders/files wich are specifically for use in a certain time period in wich the project is active. For example: teenagerclub folder/file for one specific evening.

### Names

Filenames and projectnames shall be built with this Naming Convention. This convention has the idea to be as human readable as Possible. All filenames have to be in kebab-case.
